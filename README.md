# kv-new-react-boilerplate

This is the new React boilerplate with latest React, Redux and Webpack.


The UI is built using:

 * react: https://facebook.github.io/react/
 * redux: https://github.com/reactjs/redux
 * react-router: https://github.com/reactjs/react-router
 * seamless-immutable: https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable
 * scss: https://sass-lang.com/

## Development/Local running

To start developing this UI you there are some prerequisites:

* node.js ~ 8.11.2
* npm ~ 5.5.1
* webpack ~ 3.8.1

They all need to be installed globally (i.e. with `npm install -g`)

To develop/run the ui locally execute the following steps:

1. Install the prereqs mentioned above.
2. Check out the project from BitBucket [kv-new-react-boilerplate](https://bitbucket.org/keyvaluesoftwaresystems/kv-new-react-boilerplate/)
3. Run `npm install`
4. To run the local server (in dev mode) run `npm run serve`

### npm tasks

- `npm test` runs tests with Jest
- `npm run clean` cleans the `./dist` directory
- `npm run eslint` runs `eslint`
- `npm run storybook` creates a storybook in `./dist`
- `npm run build-production` builds production in `./dist/
- `npm run serve` runs a development server on port 8090
- `npm run tests` runs eslint and jest test
- `npm run reports` runs eslint and coverage summary
- `npm run eslint` runs eslint test
- `npm run eslint-json-summary` generates json file with eslint test summary
- `npm run eslint-report` generates html file with eslint test reports
- `npm run coverage` shows jest test coverage
- `npm run coverage-summary` generates json file with test coverage

### Precommit Hooks

`npm run tests` is run as a precommit hook

See [here](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for more development related info.
See [here](docs/GUIDELINES.md) for general guidelines.

## Deployment

Deployment can be done as a Web App.

### Deployment as Web App

`npm run build` generates an index.html with the js bundle, css bundle and all assets which can be deployed directly on a web server. The js and css bundles are hashed for setting a long cache.

### Deployment as Web App in a Docker Container

Pre-requisite:
* Docker

We may use docker containers for deployment. 
The docker container should be first built using `build.sh` and then installed using `run.sh`.

After running `run.sh`, the application can be accessed at `http://{server}:8081`

NOTE: To run docker without using `sudo` please follow the steps mentioned [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
